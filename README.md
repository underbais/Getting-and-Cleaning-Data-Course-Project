# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

## This repo contains the following files:

* tidy_data_set.txt, which is a final tidy data set for this project
* Readme.md, which describes the project and how the scripts are working
* CodeBook.md, which outlines the data, variables and transformations done on them
* run_analysis.R, which is the script itself

## Steps to create final tidy data set

1. Download the data and unzip it
2. Read the data into variables
3. Extract activity and participant data
4. Load test and training datasets with mean and standard deviation only
5. Merge training and test datasets
6. Write final dataset to tidy_data_set.txt file
